            ARU has embarked on offering health-related services to communities.
            This is done with guidance from the local authorities and the
            Ministry of Health guidelines. ARU is working with public health
            centres to extend integrated health services to far-reaching
            communities like HIV prevention, care and treatment services,
            contraception, and Maternal Health care.
            <br />
            Furthermore, through the Community Health Promoters and the
            peer-to-peer model, ARU has been able to boost community awareness
            on HIV prevention and home improvement health campaigns among
            adolescents and most at-risk communities, which minimizes the spread
            of sexually transmitted infections and cases of Gender-Based
            Violence.

          ARU believes that building a sustainable and resilient future begins
          with addressing the urgent challenges posed by environmental
          degradation and climate change. Our work focuses on empowering
          communities to adapt to these changes while advocating for long-term
          solutions that prioritize both people and the planet.
          <br />
          ARU focuses on empowering communities to adapt to climate change
          through initiatives that enhance resilience to extreme weather,
          promote sustainable land use, energy conservation, and waste
          management. We emphasize education and advocacy to raise awareness of
          the links between human health, livelihoods, and climate change. By
          supporting community-led solutions like reforestation, clean energy,
          and sustainable agriculture, we aim to build a sustainable,
          climate-resilient future.

            ARU employs needs assessment and participatory approaches to
            identify economic vulnerabilities amongst communities it serves.
            With this, local authorities and community members have been engaged
            to plan, establish and implement livelihood programs like
            (vocational training in Tailoring, Bakery, Crocheting, and soap
            making, Hair dressing, supporting agriculture ventures) and all
            these skills address the identified economic vulnerabilities thus

            gender inequality is actively addressed.
            <br />
            Our gender mainstreaming initiatives focus on empowering women,
            promoting gender equality, and reducing gender-based violence. ARU
            works with local communities to challenge harmful gender norms,
            foster inclusive participation, and ensure that the voices of
            marginalized groups, particularly women and girls, are heard and
            valued.
